title: Why do we visualise data?

## Motivation

Data visualisations can be a very efficient means of identifying patterns in data and conveying a message. The scientific aim of any visualisation is to allow the reader to understand data:

-   intuitively;

-   efficiently; and

-   accurately. 

If designed and executed successfully, a data visualisation will:

-   

    Grab attention

    :   In a sea of text, a visualisation will stand out. If a reader is short of time or not convinced that the content might be interesting, visuals are frequently key in deciding whether or not to study the entire document.

-   

    Improve access to information

    :   Textual descriptions can be lengthy and hard to read, while skillfully created visualisations permit the extraction of key information more efficiently, making information extraction a fun task.

-   

    Increase precision

    :   Textual descriptions are frequently less precise than a visual depiction showing data points and corresponding axes, while a text with too many precise numbers can make it hard to follow a line of argument.

-   

    Add credibility

    :   While a textual summary provides a story, a visualisation of the data themselves can add credibility to otherwise unsubstantiated claims about the data: readers can see the numbers for themselves and arrive at the same conclusions.

-   

    Summarise content

    :   Visual displays allow for summarising complex textual content, aiding the reader in memorising key points.

For these reasons, data visualisations are key elements in almost any kind of publication -- scientific papers, media reports, conference presentations, etc.

Tables, too, are a way to visualise data or statistics, and can be similarly important components of a publication. A table may in some cases visualise data better than a graphic. For example, five numbers are probably better displayed in a table than in a complex pie chart that uses colours, angles, and possibly shading and more than two dimensions. 

## A brief history of data visualisation

Visualisation in itself has been a topic of scientific research for a long time. An early visualisation was created by Minard in 1861, depicting data from Napoleon's march on Moscow in 1812/13 and his subsequent retreat (below).

The map shows latitude and longitude of the army as it moved. The line shows the direction of the move, and the line width represents the size of the army (the surviving soldiers). Particular locations were marked by the date of the army presence, and the temperature is shown, too. Six variables were elegantly woven into a single display (References: Tufte, The visual display of quantitative information; Corbett, Charles Joseph Minard, Mapping Napoleon's March; Robinson AH, The thematic maps of Charles Joseph Minard).

Data were visualised by hand until computers came along. The first monitors and printers worked in text mode only, though, with a resolution of 25 rows and 80 columns or similar, not permitting much detail or precision. Graphics terminals and printers followed, and resolutions kept increasing with the development of laser printers.

Statistical systems such as SAS enabled creation of data visualisations early on (reference to an early manual or other work needed).

Arguably the most consistent implementation of a graphics system was realised with ggplot (Wickham, 2011) based on Wilkinson's "The Grammar of Graphics" (2005).

A key component of ggplot2 is the feature of creating conditional displays. These allow for subsetting the data by the values of one or more variables. The concept was introduced by Cleveland (1993), showcasing a barley data set that was analysed in textbooks for decades until a visualisation strongly suggested an error in the data set -- two years of crop yield of one variety at one of six farms were accidentally swapped. It took a visualisation to reveal what numerous numerical analyses had missed!

Cleveland named the display type "trellis", being inspired by a trellis in his garden (Cleveland, 1993). The trellis concept was first implemented in S (Becker and Chambers, 1984) and S-PLUS (**ref**). When R (ref) came along, a package lattice was developed (Sarkar 2008) since trellis carried a trademark. With the advent of ggplot, the term faceting was introduced (with functions facet_grid and facet_wrap).
